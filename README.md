## Bugs: 

### Solved bugs: 
After deployment to GitHub, the media queries controlling responsive elements of the site were not being detected. This was fixed via an adjustment to the head section of the HTML of each page, namely using the meta tag <meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" name="viewport"/> to allow the screen width to be detected correctly.

### Unfixed bugs:
No unfixed bugs.

## Deployment:
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. To deploy the site:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab. 
From the source section dropdown menu, select the Main branch. 
The page then provided the link to the completed website.
