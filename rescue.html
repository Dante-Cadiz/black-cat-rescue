        <h2>How to get involved in rescue projects near you</h2>
        <p>
            Donating to local animal shelters is one of the best ways to support cats. <br>
            As non-profit organisations, these businesses constantly struggle to finance their operations. Your donations make a huge difference in allowing shelters to provide resources to rescue and rehome many more cats and kittens. <br>
            This money is essential for food, veterinary bills, equipment, premises, and advertising. <br>
            Even the smallest of donations can make a significant difference and allow another cat to find a safe and loving home. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Not every cat lover has the room in their home or finances to permanently adopt a new rescue animal. However, short term fostering of a cat while the search for their forever home continues can be immensely beneficial. <br>
            Shelters lack the room to house cats for long periods of time. Along with this, they are not ideal environments for young kittens to learn human socialisation; a loving home with extended 1 to 1 contact is much better during that key knowledge acquisition period. <br>
            Fostering an animal takes huge pressure off shelters and allows a new space to be opened up for another cat from the street. <br> 
        </p>
        <p>Trap Neuter Return (TNR for short) is a process designed to improve the quality of life of local feral cat populations. <br>
            Not all cats can be 'rescued' and domesticated - adult feral cats who have never been socialised with humans are much happier living outdoors. <br>
            Instead the best approach to helping these animals is to trap, neuter and return them to the wild. <br>
        Neutered cats live longer, healthier lives and are at less risk of contracting FIV and FeLV, as these diseases are typically transferred during fighting (which neutered cats are less likely to do) and mating. <br>
        Most importantly, neutered cats cannot breed, meaning that the number of kittens born on the street is reduced, and those that are born can be rescued more easily due to division of resources.<br>
        TNR schemes are widely participated in across the country, and if you love cats, it is worthwhile to contact your local one and volunteer - it makes an immeasurable difference.
